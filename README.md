## A Guide to the Development of the Kascope Robotic Arm

### What's Covered: 
The purpose of this document is to help the reader through the process of robotic development using ROS (Robotic operating system) to the point where they feel comfortable configuring, developing, and maintianing the robotic arm. This document will cover a lot of basic ROS topics, but will focus on the 6DOF arm. Other documents will be kept for other robotic platforms.
